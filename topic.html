                "ChatGPT is a natural language processing tool driven by AI technology that allows you to have human-like conversations and much more with the chatbot. The language model can
                answer questions and assist you with tasks, such as composing emails, essays, and code." Ortiz, S. (2023).

            <em>
                ChatGPT has a significant importance in our society as it offers numerous advantages in the realm of education, work, or just in general if you require someone to talk to.
                It includes the utilization of various systems like
                virtual mentors, voice assistants, cutting-edge content, intelligent classrooms, automated evaluation, and customized learning experiences. Kasneci (2023) says that for
                university students it can assist in research and writing tasks, as well as in the development of critical thinking and problem solving skills.
