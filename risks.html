        <em>
            Although there are many advantages of ChatGPT in the general aspects of things, there are also the disadvantages and risk of ChatGPT. There are currently limitations whether that would be trying to understand
            different complex scientific complications and contextual awareness. There could also be a lack of accountablity hence it could raise ethical concerns (McGee, R. W., 2023). In the education environment,
            there are obviously the questions of boundaries regarding cheating and plagarism. "ChatGPT poses different threats to the traditional education and research system, including the possibility of cheating
            on online exams, human-like text generation, diminished critical thinking skills, and difficulties in evaluating information generated by ChatGPT." (Sok, S., & Heng, K., 2023). Currently in many high schools,
            universities and some work places are holding guidelines and boundaries on how they can use ChatGPT as it has created some worry around the risks of "completing written assignments and examinations on behalf of
            students" (Lo, C.K, 2023). Current in Auckland University of Technology (AUT), there are already guidelines to what we can use ChatGPT for and how it can help us. They have an anti-plagiarism software, Turnitin, and
            it detects AI writing detection features and it has a 98% confidence rating.
